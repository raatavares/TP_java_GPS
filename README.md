## Vision and Scope

#### Problem Statement
##### Project background

This section contains a summary of the problem that the project will solve. It should provide a brief history of the problem and an explanation of how the organization justified the decision to build software to address it. This section should cover the reasons why the problem exists, the organization's history with this problem, any previous projects that were undertaken to try to address it, and the way that the decision to begin this project was reached. 

##### Stakeholders

This is a bulleted list of the stakeholders. Each stakeholder may be referred to by name, title, or role ("support group manager," "CTO," "senior manager"). The needs of each stakeholder are described in a few sentences. 

##### Users

This is a bulleted list of the users. As with the stakeholders, each user can either be referred to by name or role ("support rep," "call quality auditor," "home web site user")however, if there are many users, it is usually inefficient to try to name each one. The needs of each user are described.

#### Vision & Scope of the Solution

##### Vision statement

The goal of the vision statement is to describe what the project is expected to accomplish. It should explain what the purpose of the project is. This should be a compelling reason, a solid justification for spending time, money, and resources on the project. The best time to write the vision statement is after talking to the stakeholders and users and writing down their needs; by this time, a concrete understanding of the project should be starting to jell.

##### List of features

This section contains a list of features. A feature is as a cohesive area of the software that fulfills a specific need by providing a set of services or capabilities. Any software package, in fact, any engineered product, can be broken down into features. The project manager can choose the number of features in the vision and scope document by changing the level of detail or granularity of each feature, and by combining multiple features into a single one. Sometimes those features are small ("screw-top cap," "holds one liter of liquid"); sometimes they are big ("four-wheel drive," "seats seven passengers"). It is useful to describe a product in about 10 features in the vision and scope document, because this usually yields a level of complexity that most people reading it are comfortable with. Adding too many features will overwhelm most readers. 

Each feature should be listed in a separate paragraph or bullet point. It should be given a name, followed by a description of the functionality that it provides. This description does not need to be detailed; it can simply be a few sentences that give a general explanation of the feature. However, if there is more information that a stakeholder or project team member feels should be included, it is important to include that information. For example, it is sometimes useful to include a use case (see Chapter 6), as long as it is written in such a way that all of the stakeholders can read and understand it. 

##### Features that will not be developed

Features are often left out of a project on purpose. When a feature is explicitly left out of the software, it should be added to this section to tell the reader that a decision was made to exclude it. For example, one way to handle an unrealistic deadline is by removing one or more features from the software, in which case the removed features should be moved into this section. The reason these features should be moved rather than deleted from the document is that otherwise, readers might assume that they were overlooked and bring them up in a review. This is especially important during the review of the document because it allows everyone to agree on the exclusion of the feature (or object to it). 

##### Risk

Risks are potential uncertainties or adverse events that can impact the achievement of objectives and require proactive management to mitigate or minimize their negative effects.


##### Assumptions

This is the list of assumptions that the stakeholders, users, or project team have made. The team should hold a brainstorming session to come up with a list of assumptions. (See Chapter 3 for more information on assumptions.)
